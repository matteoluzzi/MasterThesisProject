Deployment
===============================================================

The simplest way to deploy the service is to get a copy of its single jar file and to create or copy the configuration file.
It is possible as well to deploy it using `Chef <http://www.opscode.com/chef>`_ scripts that we have implemented and that can
be provided with the service.
